## Ft_ls

The focus on this project was to introduce the inner-workings 
of filesystems and how to traverse and inspect them. 
My goal was to implement an exact copy of the original ls command.
 
usage: ft_ls [-lAaRr] [file ...]
-a (include '.' dirs) 
-A (List all) 
-l (show long format) 
-r (reverse listing)
-R (recursively down)

All can be ran together, but a shorter example is shown below.
